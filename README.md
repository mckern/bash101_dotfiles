# Bash 101: What Are Dot Files?

## The pitch!

Take a walk through the history of the shell and see some tools designed to make customizing and managing the command line a little less intimidating.

## OK, but what is this really?

A long-ish lightning talk or short-ish featured talk, given at [Donut.js](https://donutjs.club) on 30 January 2018. The slides are slightly longer than what I was able to cover in the time alloted so some of this content may be broken out into a second talk in the future. In retrospect, piloting a new tool, a new talk, and live demos may have been a slightly tall order for the time alloted.

## The slides!

The slides are [available here](http://mckern.github.io/bash101_dotfiles). The deck responds to all of the standard [Remark](http://remarkjs.com/) keyboard shortcuts (`←` is back, `→` is forward, `P` will show presenter notes) but the interactive terminal has been removed.

## The video!

You can see me ham-fist my way through this talk in [all my pudding-golem glory here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7nxFR18Qbk).

## Thanks!

Many thanks to Donut.js, which is run by wonderfully welcoming folks who did not chide me even a little for going over time.

Thanks also to [Daniel G. Taylor](https://github.com/danielgtaylor) for his work on [Tech Talk](https://github.com/danielgtaylor/tech-talk), which is the basis of [my own fork](https://github.com/mckern/tech-talk/). Tech Talk is a fun tool to present Markdown slides with, and an equally fun tool to hack on.
